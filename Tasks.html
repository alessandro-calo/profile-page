  <li>Open the JSfiddle project shared by your tutor</li>
  <li>In Settings, enable "Highlight matching tags" and anything else you want</li>
  <li>Feel free to ASK your tutor/consultant/friend/new BFF, or simply use Google! (search hint: "HTML/CSS how to xxxxxxx")</li>
  <li>Add a welcome message paragraph saying "Hi! I am"</li>
  <li>Now make the welcome message of your page bolder (hint: stronger) by using a suitable HTML tag</li>
  <li>Add a heading to your page with your name</li>
  <li>Style your heading tag by giving it some padding on top, setting its "font-weight" or changing its "font-size".</li>
  <li>Add a tagline about yourself in a paragraph tag.</li>
  <li>Give your tagline a unique id (e.g. "light-purple") and then use this id to color the text.</li>
  <li>Add another paragraph tag with a description of yourself.</li>
  <li>You can experiment and make certain parts of your paragraph bold or italic by using the right html tags ;)</li>
  <li>Now insert a link in your description paragraph forwarding to "https://netlight.com" with an "a" tag.</li>
  <li>Make a new bullet-point list, e.g. with your interests.</li>
  <li>Give your bullet points some styling, e.g. change the "font-size".</li>
  <li>Below everything, add a "button" tag with a meaningful text, e.g. "Contact me".</li>
  <li>Try to style the button by referencing the "button" tag in the CSS file. What looks nice is: uppercase text, dark background and white text.</li>
  <li>You can also try to give the button text some padding.</li>
  <li>Now, above all the tags, but inside the body, add an image (Hint: try googling an image and open it in a new tab to get and image url. (You can also use your LinkedIn profile picture)</li>
  <li>We recommend you to give your image a width of approximately 300 pixels (for this you can use a class or the tag for styling in CSS).</li>
  <li>Let's try to give our page some organization: put a "div" tag around the image and another one around all of the other tags in your page.</li>
  <li>Give both of the newly added "div" tags a class (e.g "container").</li>
  <li>Style the divs by using the "container" class. We suggest you restrict the width by setting the "max-width" property to 600px.
    It's also nice to give them some padding and also use the property "display: inline-block;".
    Further use "verical-align: top;". Do you see the difference?
  </li>
  <li>You can give your second "div" container one more class (e.g "grey-background") and try to give it another "background-color" by using this new class.</li>
  <li>Got time? Advanced stuff!
    <ol>
      <li>Add an "onclick" property in HTML to the button: "onclick=myFunction()"</li>
      <li>Write a Javascript function with the name "myFunction" - start with the keyword "function", then the name of your function, then an empty list of parameters "()", then "{" to open it's body and "}" to close it.</li>
      <li>Inside the body of your function, do this: alert("I can do web");</li>
      <li>Try clicking on the button!</li>
      <li>Copy all html and create a file on your computer named "page.html"</li>
      <li>Copy all CSS and create a file on your computer in the same directory as the html file named "styles.css"</li>
      <li>Now google on how to include css into your html file</li>
      <li>Open the page.html file in your browser!</li>
    </ol>
